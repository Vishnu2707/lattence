Decision: Core models use a shared namespace package with graph-owned schemas.
Rationale: Separate workspace packages can extend one public Python namespace.

2026-09-08 D-002
Decision: The documented rule schema is bundled with the discovery package.
Rationale: Installed wheels validate offline, while a test prevents schema drift.

2026-09-08 D-003
Decision: The root project builds the public package from `lattence-cli/src`.
Rationale: One distribution owns the binary while workspace libraries stay separate.
