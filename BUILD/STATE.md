## v0.5 acceptance before release gate

- A fresh local clone built the wheel and loaded only its packaged Lattence
  modules against the cached dependency environment.
- Plain TUI output exposed all twelve navigation sections with no color
  escapes, and JSON output matched the dashboard `presentation.json`
  byte-for-byte.
- The acceptance check found the real two-hop `LT-AI-002` to `LT-PQC-203`
  chain, matched both hops to stored graph edges, retained evidence from
  `app.py` and `crypto_config.py`, and found every dashboard asset.
- CI now repeats the presentation checks from its clean wheel environment.
